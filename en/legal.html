<div class="container">

<p>In compliance with the provisions of Article 10 of Spanish Law 34/2002, of July 11, on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce, we inform you that the web site <a href="https://www.muraip.com/">https://www.muraip.com/</a> (hereinafter, "the Web Site") is owned by INGELABS S.L. (hereinafter, "INGELABS"), with VAT number ESB92727205 and registered address at Av. Juan López Peñalver 21, 29590 Málaga (Spain).</p>

<p>MURA and MURA IP are trademarks owned by INGELABS S.L.</p>

<h2>Agreement to the terms of use</h2>

<p>This Legal Notice regulates access and use of the Web Site that INGELABS makes available to users. A "user" is any person who accesses, navigates, uses or participates in the services and activities of the Web Site.</p>

<p>Access to and use of the Web Site by the user implies the acceptance of the entirety of the terms of use in this Legal Notice. In case of disagreement with these terms, you must refrain from using the Web Site.</p>

<p>The services provided by INGELABS through the Web Site are free of charge, unless otherwise explicitly stated. Access to this Web Site does not in any way imply the beginning of a commercial relationship with INGELABS.</p>

<h2>Intellectual and industrial property</h2>

<p>The intellectual property rights of the content of the Web Site, their graphic design and codes are the property of INGELABS and, therefore, it is prohibited to reproduce, distribute, publicly communicate, transform or carry out any other activity with the content of the Web Site, even if the sources are cited, unless prior, express and written consent has been obtained from INGELABS.</p>

<p>All commercial names, brands or different signs of any kind contained in the Web Site are the property of their owners, and are protected by law.</p>

<p>INGELABS does not grant any license or authorization of use of any kind on their rights of intellectual and industrial property or any other property or right related to the Web Site, and in no case shall it be understood that access and navigation of users implies a waiver, transmission, license or transfer of all or part of such rights by INGELABS.</p>

<p>Any use of these contents not previously authorised by INGELABS will be considered a serious breach of intellectual or industrial property rights and will give rise to the legally established responsibilities. INGELABS reserves the right to exercise against the user the corresponding judicial and extrajudicial actions.</p>

<h2>Warranty and liability</h2>

<p>INGELABS has made every effort to ensure that the information on the Web Site is accurate and up to date. However, INGELABS neither guarantees nor shall bear any liability for the accuracy and updating of the Web Site contents. INGELABS is not responsible for any error or omission in the Web Site contents and reserves the right to modify the said contents at any time without prior notice. Likewise, INGELABS may at any time and without prior notice suspend access to the Web Site for maintenance, update or improvement purposes.</p>

<p>No commercial transactions are performed on the Web Site and none of its contents may be considered a contractual offer to the user. The business relationship between INGELABS and its customers is governed by INGELABS' General Terms and Conditions and/or by other general conditions or specific agreements. The Web Site contents do not take precedence over the terms of the business relationship between INGELABS and its customers, nor do they determine the sales policy that INGELABS decides to adopt at any time.</p>

<p>The fact that the Web Site describes or presents certain products does not imply a commitment by INGELABS that said products will be available to the user.</p>

<p>The Web Site may contain statements of a subjective nature that express the opinions of INGELABS or third parties on future events and which are therefore subject to uncertainty. INGELABS shall not be held liable for the influence these statements may have on the user or their consequences on the user's actions or omissions.</p>

<p>INGELABS is not liable for any errors or malfunctions of the Web Site, whether intrinsic or due to the features and limitations of the Internet. The user assumes all risks arising from the use of the Internet, including the possible transmission of computer viruses. INGELABS does not guarantee the uninterrupted operation of the Web Site's services and shall not be held liable for any damage or losses caused by the interruption of the said services. In particular, INGELABS shall not be held liable due to circumstances of force majeure such as fires, strikes and electric power supply cuts, or any other unforeseen or unavoidable events.</p>

<p>In any case, INGELABS shall only be liable for damages that were foreseen or could have been anticipated during use of the Web Site by the user, and which are a direct and necessary consequence of a grossly negligent breach of substantial contractual obligations.</p>

<p>The exclusion of liability and warranties described in this section shall apply to both INGELABS and its directors, managers, employees and representatives.</p>

<p>In compliance with Articles 11 and 16 of Spanish Law 34/2002, of July 11, on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce, INGELABS is committed to the elimination or the blocking of content that could affect or be contrary to current legislation, the rights of third parties, or public morality and order.</p>

<h2>Personal data and privacy</h2>

<p>Please check our Privacy Policy <a href="/en/privacy">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>The presence of links on the Web Site to other sites on the Internet is for information purposes only and in no case implies a suggestion, invitation or recommendation about them. INGELABS does not assume responsibility for the contents of links belonging to foreign websites, nor does it guarantee their reliability, accuracy, comprehensiveness, veracity, validity and technical availability.</p>

<p>In the event that other websites link to the Web Site, it shall not be understood that INGELABS has authorised the link or the content of the websites containing such links.</p>

<h2>Applicable law and jurisdiction</h2>

<p>The terms of use of the Web Site contained in this legal notice, as well as the relationship between the user and INGELABS, shall be governed and understood in accordance with Spanish law. To resolve any conflict that might arise, the parties expressly submit to the competence and jurisdiction of the courts in the city of Málaga, expressly waiving the right to any other jurisdiction they might be entitled to.</p>

<h2>Modifications of these terms</h2>

<p>INGELABS reserves the right to update this Legal Notice at anytime without prior notice. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to periodically review this Legal Notice.</p>
